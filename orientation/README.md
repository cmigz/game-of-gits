# Web Development Immersive Orientation

## Welcome to Web Developement Immersive

We are super excited to have you as part of our flagship program here at General
Assembly! This README will provide all the information you will need to be
successfully oriented into the Web Development Immersive Program.

## Before we get started

Please be sure that your computer is up-to-date with the most recent version of
your operating system.

### OS X

Please upgrade to the latest version of OS X, Sierra (10.12).

### Windows or Linux

General Assembly no longer officially supports Windows or Linux in immersive
programs. If you have a Windows or a Linux machine, you should contact your
Immersive Producer. Instructors may provide support for these operating systems
 at their own discretion.

If you are on a Windows machine, you **must** set up your computer to dual-boot
Linux Ubuntu before you can get started.  ***Running a VM will not do!***

*Times and Events are subject to change*

## Consultant Team Introductions

Throughout the Web Development Immersive program, you will have a dedicated team
of Consultants provide you with training, support and direction. During this
portion of Orientation you can expect to learn:

-   Names of the consultant team members
-   How long they have been with General Assembly
-   What they were doing prior to General Assembly
-   Learn an interesting fact or guilty pleasure from each
-   Learn their favorite applications and why

## Icebreakers

During this portion of orientation, we will begin to break the 'ice' and get
to know eachother a bit better!

### Two Truth's and a Lie

Here's how to play:

-   Write 3 interesting facts on the lined side of a 3x5 index card
-   Two of the facts are **true** and one of the facts will be a **lie**
-   Keep in mind that the lie should be believable like a truth and the truths
could be lies
-   Cards are collected, shuffled and passed back out
-   'Johnny' starts and reads the facts on the card he holds
-   'Johnny' has 2 guesses to indentify the person whos card he's holding
-   After 2 guess, if 'Johnny' is not correct, 'Jane' shares that it's her card
-   'Johnny' now has 2 guesses to try and pick the fact that is the **lie**
-   'Johnny' highlights which fact is the **lie** and 'Jane' on blank side of
the index card
-   'Jane' goes next and reads the facts on the card she holds
-   This continues until everyone has played!

## Alumni Panel

Let's be honest, deciding to make the life changing decision to enroll in this
full-time immersive program, most likely came with some questions and possible
doubt. This portion of orientation will give you the opportunity to hear from
alumni from past Web Development Immersive programs. You can expect to hear:

-   Names of each alumni panelist and what they were doing before WDI
-   What the alumni do now after successfully completing the program
-   What their experience was like in WDI
-   What some the challenges were that they faced during their cohorts
-   What was something they wish they knew at the start of the program
-   Open the floor up for questions

Example questions to ask:

-   What do you wish someone had told you? Would you have believed it?
-   How long was the gap in time between learning something and feeling
comfortable using it?
-   What is your learning process on-the-job?
-   How important were the projects for your learning and comfort?
-   What was it like day-to-day and week-to-week during the program?
-   How did you convince someone that you can do the job even though you
don't have experience?
-   What was your highest level of education? Did your degree matter?

## Consultant Q&A

You just heard from various WDI alumni, now is your opportunity
to ask the Consultant team questions you'd like answered. From each
Consultant, you can expect to hear:

-   More about their background and journey
-   How they began their careers in web development
-   The biggest challenge they had in starting their careers
-   Projects they've worked on

Here are some example questions you should ask:

-   What do you believe the key to success is in this program?
-   What is your personality and communication style?
-   How do I keep a positive attitude when things seem impossible?
-   Any words of wisdom before we begin this journey?

## Expectations & Policies

We take great pride in our Web Development Immersive program! A main reason why
our program is so successful is due to **very** clear expectations and policies
we have in place. You will find these below.

First and foremost, to be successful in this program, it is **imperative** that
you understand what a **_Growth Mindset_** is and have one!

![Growth Mindset Chart](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/388761/21698706/4c6a08d8-d366-11e6-8758-8bf63f65fe60.jpg)

**GROWTH MINDSET DIAGRAM**

**MUST WATCH** [The power of belief: Mindset & Success](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pN34FNbOKXc)

**Please Note** : The goal of the program is not to produce working code,
working code is a by-product of the goal. The goal of the program is to learn
how to create working code.

### Diagnostics

-   Diagnostics will be given regularly, and are designed to reflect
recently-covered material
-   These diagnostics scores will not impact your completion; they are a tool
for you and us to gauge your comprehension of the material
-   **Don't stress out about these diagnostics, and don't obsess over the
results**

### Practice

-   Practice will be assigned semi-regularly, and will be assessed in terms of:

    -   Code quality (e.g. indentation, good comments, readability, etc.)
    -   Functionality (Does it run correctly? Is it robust? Is it efficient?)

-   However, as important as doing your practice work is, remember that the
most important thing is what you're learning.

### Professionalism

-   We will treat you like adults and expect you to behave like adults.
-   Disagreements with other students should be resolved on your own.
-   As with every rule, there are exceptions. If any student is behaving in a
way that is disrespectful and/or dangerous towards their fellow developers,
that should be brought to the producer's attention immediately. Similarly,
any issues that involved consultants should be brought to the producer's
attention immediately
-   Please see the 'Code of Conduct' portion of your student enrollment
agreement if you have questions about this

### Independence

-   We will do our best to train you with everything we can in the time we have.
 However, the ultimate responsibility for what you learn lies with **YOU**.
-   If you're having trouble with material, ask questions. See out consultants
outside of class. Find extra tutorials online.
-   If you're ahead, ask for more work!

### Attendance

#### Late arrivals and Early departures

-   If you arrive after **9:00am** you are late. Any
training missed is your responsibility to make up.
-   If you are not present at the beginning of afternoon announcements, or if you leave before **5:00pm**, you will accrue one early departure.
-   If your late arrivals and early departures exceed **5**, you will not
successfully complete the program.

#### Absences

-   If you miss more than **3** days regardless of reason, you will not
successfully complete the program

-   If you know of a planned absence(s), please contract a producer ASAP

### Successful Completion Requirements

-   Program Attendance
-   Successful completion of **ALL** projects
-   Submission of all Assignments
-   Outcomes Programming Attendance
-   Outcomes Programming Participation

### Rewards for Successful Completion

-   Post-graduation outcomes support
-   Participation in the Meet & Hire
-   Letter and Certificate of Completion
-   Participation in sem-anual Graduation Celebration
-   You may also request a reference or recommendation from Consultants

## Workspace Culture

Break into groups of three or four. In your group, discuss and outline your
expectations of each other as colleagues. Then, we'll share what each group has
discussed and record a social contract.

Most groups of developers come up with something like the following:

-   Respect is mutually given, not earned; follow [Wheaton's
    Law](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wheatons-law)
-   Be an open communicator; do not disengage when working in a group, and
    practice active listening.
-   Be open to constructive feedback; when giving feedback, be specific.
-   Take others' intent into account; follow [Hanlon's
    Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor).
-   Be collaborative, share freely, and respect others' abilities and
    preferences.
-   Maintain a growth mindset and a good attitude.
-   Ask lots of questions, but do your due diligence!
-   Leave outside stress and your ego at the door.
-   Foster a space where it safe to fail and learn from mistakes.
-   Have fun!

## Staff Introductions

Majority of your experiences in the program workspace will have you interact
with the consultants, production, outcomes and operations teams. However, there
are additional departments working hard, behind the scenes, to ensure your
experience along with that of future programs are the best they possibly can be.

This portion will allow you to meet some additional friendly faces that you will
see around campus. This includes:

-   Senior Leadership
-   Marketing
-   Partnerships
-   Classes, Events & Workshops
-   Admissions
-   Product
-   Other Immersive Programs Teams

## Operations

We want to ensure that you have the best experience possible during your time in
WDI! One of the key components to ensure outstanding student experiences is our
Operations team.

Who makes up our Operations team? Our **Campus Commander** and
**Front-Lines** staff.

The Operations team is responsible for so many crucial parts of our campus and
programs, that we cannot list them all, but here are several things you could go
to them for:

-   Adjusting the temperature of the workspace
-   Conference room bookings
-   Printing
-   Office supplies
-   Loaner computer
-   And many more!

Since we are in a co-working space called, WeWork, there are some additional
amenities you'll have access to. But first, we should define what our
relationship with WeWork looks like. We rent out our 4 workspace rooms from
WeWork. What this means is that we **do not own** WeWork **nor** does WeWork own
General Assembly! Here are area's that you'll have access to, but are not
**_exclusive_** to General Assembly students or staff:

-   The Dugout
-   Kitchen areas
-   Floors 1, 2, 6, 7 (This includes kitchens, conference rooms, phone
booths, etc. on those floors)

How do I get access to these amenities you might ask. You have to provide three
pieces of information to our Campus Commander:

-   Picture of your Photo I.D. / Identification
-   Picture of you, shoulder up, with a white background (Selfie)
-   First Name, Last Name and Email Address

Once the Campus Commander has these three items **_FROM EVERYONE_**, access
cards will be created and handed out. **PLEASE NOTE** No one will receive their
access card until all information is collected!

We will be collecting these access cards on your final day of the program.

## Outcomes

One of the most valuable resources and benefits from participating in an
Immersive Program at General Assembly is our Outcomes Team. Upon successful
completion of the Web Development Immersive Program, you will have access to
this great resourse! During this segment, you will have a chance to hear from
you Outcomes Producer and to get a high level snapshot of what you can expect
for Outcomes throughout the course.

You will have much more information provided during your first Outcomes
Programming session, so do not worry if every question you have is not answered
during this segment!
